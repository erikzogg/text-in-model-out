After an employee has created a new ticket, the service desk agent reads the description of the ticket. The ticket is then categorized. If the ticket contains too little information, the ticket is rejected and closed. The process ends at this point. Otherwise, the service desk agent tries to reproduce the customer's problem. If service desk agent fails to reproduce and examine the problem, the request is forwarded to 2nd level support. At the same time, the customer is informed about the forwarding to 2nd level support. The process also ends at this point. Otherwise, the service desk agent searches for a solution in the company's internal knowledge database. At the same time, the employee is informed that the problem could be reproduced. If a solution is found in the knowledge base, the solution is sent to the employee. In the other case, a solution is searched for. In addition, the solution found is entered into the knowledge base. After that, the ticket is marked as completed.

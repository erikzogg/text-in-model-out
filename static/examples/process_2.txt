The procurement department receives the list of all required parts. Then, the procurement department goes over the stock. If the stock contains enough parts, a supply order is sent to the logistics department. Otherwise, suppliers must first be selected and then so that later an order can be sent. After these activities have been completed, the logistics department provides all the required parts. Next, the logistics department transports all parts to the manufacturing department. The manufacturing department now starts production. The parts are assembled. At the same time, the electrical system is installed, configured and tested. Once these activities have been executed, the logistics department prepares the produced product for shipping. Finally, the logistics department sends the product by post.

A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are unacceptable, she takes her computer home unrepaired. Otherwise, the CRS checks and repairs the hardware while the software is checked and configured. The flow is merged. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair is finished. The flow is merged.

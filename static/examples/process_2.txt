A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are not acceptable, she takes her computer home unrepaired. Otherwise, the hardware is checked and repaired, whereas the software is checked and configured. After each of these activities have been performed, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair is finished.

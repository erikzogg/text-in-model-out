After the service desk agent has received a new ticket, the service desk agent reads the ticket description. The ticket is then categorized. If the ticket contains too little information, the ticket is rejected. The process ends at this point. Otherwise, the service desk agent tries to reproduce the problem. If the service desk agent fails to reproduce and examine the problem, the request is forwarded to 2nd level support. At the same time, the employee is informed about the forwarding to 2nd level support. The process also ends at this point. Otherwise, the service desk agent searches for a solution in the internal knowledge database. At the same time, the employee is informed about the reproduction of the problem. Once these activities have been executed, the service desk agent checks if a solution is found in the knowledge base. If so, the solution is sent to the employee. In the other case, a solution is searched for. In addition, the solution found is entered into the knowledge base. After these activities have been completed, the ticket is closed. The process ends here.

After the authority has received an application, it checks if the applicant has unsubmitted all documents. If so, the application is postponed and the applicant is informed about the postponement. The process ends here. Otherwise, the authority notifies the applicant about the receipt of the documents. The authority then checks the acceptance of the application. If the application cannot be accepted, the applicant is notified about the rejection. Furthermore, all documents will be returned to the applicant. Otherwise, the authority prints the certificate while preparing the invoice for the applicant. Once these activities have been performed, both documents must be sent to the applicant.
